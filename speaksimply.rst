Speak simply - hints for Finnish speakers
=========================================

People *can and do* learn Finnish all the time, but many people end up
not for years and years.  Certainly the high penetration of English is
part of that.  This page gives some hints on how Finnish speakers can
help Finnish learners, because after all immersion and daily usage is
key to learning any language.  These mainly apply to technical fields
where English is the defacto language.

Finnish has many dialects, and the form we learn in classes isn't even
what most people speak.  So, a bit of help can help us to learn much
better.


Talk about unimportant things
-----------------------------
It's easy to speak Finnish - you just don't speak.  But that doesn't
help learning.

I have said "if it's not important, I can understand Finnish well.  If
it's important, I usually can't understand much."  What this basically
means that, if something is important, you end up switching to English
because we have stuff to get done.  Try to talk about unimportant
things.

But at the same time, once Finns start talking, they are very
talkative and once the speaking barrier has been passed, it goes
straight to deep topics.  As an artificial example, once someone
starts talking they don't just mention the nice weather, they begin a
comparative analysis of long-term trends and their causes.  Going too
deep, too quickly, makes it harder to understand and follow - which
isn't helpful, either.


Don't have a language binary
----------------------------
It's easy to split people into two categories: Finnish speakers and
English speakers.  If there are English speakers in *the*
conversation, speak in English.  But there are people learning
Finnish, who may be involved, or passively listening but not directly
involved.

* For those actively involved, is this conversation simple enough you
  think you can do it in Finnish?  Make it clear you are giving it a
  try and go in Finnish.  Maybe you need to throw in a few
  translations of key concepts (especially if it's domain-specific
  jargon) so that they can follow all the rest?
* If someone may be passively listening while you are talking to other
  Finnish speakers, can you simplify a bit so that they have a
  possibility to follow along and know what's going on?

Many of the other ideas below are things you can do to make this a
possibility.


Write efficiently
-----------------
Reading a few sentences to get some information may be doable.
Reading paragraphs when the main point is hidden somewhere in there
take a longer time, and thus people are less likely to do it, even if
they want to.

Try to have the main point first and easy to find, followed by
supporting information.  Can the main point/request/purpose of the
message even be clear in the first sentence, other critical
information the first paragraph, followed by supporting information?
This will probably be good for everyone anyway.


A multi-lingual message idea
----------------------------
If you do multi-lingual messages and you know most people want to read
both languages, could you be clever about it?  For example, first
"main point" paragraph in Finnish - learners can try to read it.
Then, more details in English below.  Reading either language is
enough to get the main point, and you can scan the other.  It provides
a challenge for people learning Finnish, and saves you some time in
writing everything twice.


Ask people about what they are learning
---------------------------------------
Ask people about what they are learning in classes, so you know what
level they are at and what types of topics they know about.  That way
you know how far to go and what the general progression is.  Our
textbooks tend to go in themes for each chapter, if you're talking
about something that we haven't covered yet, we'll have no idea how to
listen or speak.  Same for different word forms, etc.

Suomen Mestari is the most often used book these days (for adults),
and this is roughly how it goes.  One book is roughly half a year for
a non-intensive course:

Don't give up
-------------
Don't give up when speaking Finnish to people... they may be slow
responding, but that's OK.  Since you're talking about unimportant
things, you can take some time.


Use Finnish words
-----------------
Have to think about a word in English?  Say the Finnish one first,
help the person learn it.  Maybe even just say the Finnish one and
leave it at that, let the person learn it.  Maybe even try
intentionally using Finnish words.  This is easiest with nouns but you
could try others, too.


Try to separate words well
--------------------------
Finnish flows well, but this means that it can be hard to tell the
words apart.  Don't make it unnatural, but don't try to be as fast as
you can.  Can you make the separation of the words a bit easier to
tell?  We tell them not just by spaces, but also by emphasis of the
first syllable of each word.


Try to articulate words well, especially the ends
-------------------------------------------------
In Finnish, you have to be able to understand words from both the
beginning and *end* (because the ends have the forms).  But often times the
ends vanish, change, or otherwise are hard to pick up in spoken language.  When that
happens, us learners aren't able to pick up what is said - and
possible can't understand the whole sentence.  If you optimize the
ends of words (as spoken Finnish does), we can't figure out what you
are trying to say.


Consider your puhekieli
-----------------------
It takes a long time for people to begin learning any spoken
language - so if you are talking to beginners, they won't have mental
preparation to understand what you are saying.  Of course it can be
hard to speak kirjekieli, so try to find a proper balance.  You can
expect we should learn the simplest puhekieli, but maybe try to
simplify some of the more advanced forms.  But of course add more as
time goes on.


Listen to bad Finnish
---------------------
Unlike some languages, there is less existing culture of hearing bad
Finnish on a daily basis.  So if someone tries to say something, but
says it only slightly wrong, the listener may have no idea what it
was.  This is frustrating, but more importantly switches the
conversation to English.  Be happy with bad Finnish and try to listen
to it.

I don't know if it's even possible to find bad Finnish to practice...


It's easier to read and write
-----------------------------
When mailing/messaging people, do use more simple Finnish even if they
might not know right away.  It's good practice.  When in a big
conversation with multiple people, mention them by name so that they
know that they should pay attention to understanding it.  When
writing, all the same things on this page apply (especially the
spelling the word endings out fully part).



Don't hide Finnish text
-----------------------
This isn't really a day-to-day speaking thing, but still somewhat
relevant.  Finland has a strong bilingual culture, but emphasis is
hiding the other language (put another way, making sure that language
A speakers never have to see language B).  But that's the opposite of
what you should do with English/Finnish translations: you should not
be worried if the untranslated articles appear in Finnish too.  Put
another way, consider the Aalto University websites.  When in English
mode, anything that isn't translated just disappears.  It would be
better to have it appear in Finnish still - it's easy to skip over if
you don't want it, but if you are learning it gives you exposure.
Plus you know that something exists.


Make domain-specific cheatsheets
--------------------------------
In many languages, advanced and technical terms are similar.  Not
necessarily in Finnish, yet these advanced terms are needed for work
and stuff - and not taught in any basic courses.  My idea is that
domains can make specific cheatsheets of common terms so that people
there can learn what is relevant to them.  If anyone wants to use
Hyvää Päivää to host this, let me know.


Use children as teachers
------------------------
In the short term, our time is so limited and we talk at such a level
that we will usually end up with English.  However, there are plenty
of children who don't know English so well yet and are happy
with any kind of interaction.  Maybe invite your friends learning
Finnish to events with your children?
