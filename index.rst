Hyvää Päivää Suomi
==================

Finnish is a fascinating language.  It is very different from
anything you have learned, but also very logical.  Knowing this logic
makes learning Finnish much easier, but unfortunately usually you
don't learn the logic until you are well into courses (if ever).  This
turns what should be an enjoyable exploration of a new language into a
frustrating process which many people end up giving up on.

This course is designed to make learning Finnish fun.

This isn't a real Finnish course, it is a pre-Finnish course.  It is
designed for people who know English well enough, and are at a high
risk of dropping out of Finnish courses (most likely, because it is
not strictly needed for their jobs).  The goal of this course is to
make you appreciate and enjoy learning Finnish, which despite what
people may believe is very possible.

This course is written by someone who is learning Finnish, but by no
means knows it.  This isn't designed to be technically correct, but
easy and fun to understand.  Do not trust anything in here, but learn
it and remember once you start you own courses.
