Word structure

This chapter is about internal structure of Finnish words, in
particular the syllable structure.  In Finnish, many of the different
word changes are connected to this structure, and understanding the
structure makes doing word derivations much easier.

Syllables
---------

Words are constructed of syllables.  A syllable has a single vowel or
diphthong in the center, and possibly a consonant sound before and
after.  In Finnish, this is (practically) always a single consonant,
never several that combine into new sounds.  In this work, we let
``k`` stand for consonants and ``v`` for vowels.  Thus, in Finnish,
all syllables can fit this pattern: ``v``, ``kv``, ``vk``, or ``kvk``.

In Finnish, the most common patterns are ``kv`` and ``kvk``.  The
others exist, but less frequently.  (As a particular extreme case, it's
possible to have a multi-syllable word with no consonants at all!)

In Finnish, there are almost never three consonants in a row.  It does
happen sometimes in special places, but these are fixed circumstances
and not something that you see in new formations.

Breaking words into syllables
-----------------------------

In Finnish, a syllable (practically) *always* begins on a consonant
that proceeds a vowel.  Thus, to find syllables, look for all vowels.
See which of these have consonants right before them.  Place syllable
separators before those consonants.  Thus, we get this:
``kvk·kv·kv``.  However, there are some pattern which are not allowed
for syllables.

* A syllable can only have one vowel (``a``, ``ä``, etc) in it, or a
  long vowel consisting of two of same vowel (``aa``, ``ää``, etc), or
  a diphthong (``au``, ``öi``, etc).  If you have two vowels that
  don't form a diphthong (``ia``, ``oe``, etc. - see previous
  section), then you need a syllable break between those vowels.
* A syllable can't have a single consonant.  Ending consonants get
  joined to the syllable before (but this is included in the rule
  above actually)...

Some examples of words segmented into syllables:

* ``suo·mi``
* ``pu·hut·te·ko``
* ``e·lä·mä``
* ``työ`` (one syllable)
* ``kes·kus·tel·la``
* ``ter·ve·tu·lo·a``

As you can see, many Finnish words are are ``kv`` with occasional
``kvk`` thrown in.

Open and closed syllables
-------------------------

There is a very important difference between ``kv`` and ``kvk``

* ``kv`` is an open syllable - open, meaning that the end is *not*
  closed by a consonant.
* ``kvk`` is a closed syllable.

Words flow more naturally when it is all open syllables, and a lot of
the word changes we will learn about later are best understood by
this.

Words sound best when there is a constant flow of ``kv·kv·kv·...``,
and too many closed syllables (``kvk·kv·kvk·kv``) make speaking flow
worse.


To think about
--------------

If you add a ``-kv`` suffix on to the end of a word, it will never
affect the last syllable of the previous word (it will stay open or
closed, whatever it was before).  But if you add ``-vk`` to the end,
it might.  If you add a ``-kkv`` to the end of a word, the last
syllable of the word has to end in a vowel (and it will become
closed.)

Most of the primary word endings in Finnish are ``-k`` or ``-kkv``
(closing previous syllables), and some other important ones are
``-kv`` (no effect).

If you add a ``-kv`` suffix on to the end of a word, it will never
affect the last syllable of the previous word (it will stay open or
closed, whatever it was before).  But if you add ``vk`` or ``kkv`` to
the end of a word, it will:

* ``kv·kvk`` + ``-kv`` = ``kv·kvk·kv``  (no change)
* ``kv·kvk`` + ``-vk`` = ``kv·kv·kvk``  (opens second syllable)
* ``kv·kv``  + ``-k·kv`` = ``kv·kvk·vk``  (closes second syllable)
* ``kv·kvk`` + ``-k·kv`` = ``kv·kvkk·kv`` which is NOT allowed (two
  consonants) - this is why we have word changes.


Don't worry about this for now, this lesson is beyond what you need to
know right now - but expect it to come back in a few chapters.
